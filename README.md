## Inspiration
Millions are affected by floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and other disasters every year. Victims send desperate messages across social media, SMS, and word-of-mouth, but lack of coordination delays aid. ReliefOn was created to **bridge the gap** between victims, volunteers, NGOs, and governments using AI, real-time mapping, and multi-channel communication.

---

## What It Does
- 📲 Victims submit requests via mobile app, SMS, or WhatsApp
- 🤖 AI engine categorizes needs (food, water, shelter, medicine) and assigns urgency scores
- 🗺️ Requests appear on a real-time interactive disaster map, clustered to prevent duplication
- 👩‍🚒 Volunteers and NGOs use a dashboard to claim and resolve tasks
- 🔔 Victims are notified when their requests are fulfilled
- 🌍 Supports low-connectivity areas, offline mode, multi-language, and voice input
